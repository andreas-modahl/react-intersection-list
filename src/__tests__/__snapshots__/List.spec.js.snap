exports[`handleUpdate throws once if sentinel intersects items on mount 1`] = `
"Warning: ReactIntersectionList: the sentinel detected a viewport with a bigger size than the size of its items. This could lead to detrimental behavior, e.g.: triggering more than one onIntersection callback at the start.
To prevent this, use either a bigger \`pageSize\` value or avoid using the prop awaitMore initially."
