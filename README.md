<!-- ### An Infinite Scroller List Component -->

**React Intersection List** builds on top of **[React Intersection Observer](https://github.com/researchgate/react-intersection-observer)**, using a [sentinel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_value) in the DOM to deliver a high-performance and smooth scrolling experience, even on low-end devices.

## Getting Started

```
$ npm install --save @researchgate/react-intersection-list
```

And optionally the [polyfill](https://github.com/w3c/IntersectionObserver/tree/gh-pages/polyfill):

```
$ npm install --save intersection-observer
```

Next create a `<List>` with two instance methods for `children` and `itemRenderer`:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import List from '@researchgate/react-intersection-list';

export default class MyList extends React.Component {
    itemsRenderer = (items, ref) => (
        <ul className="list" ref={ref}>
            {items}
        </ul>
    );

    itemRenderer = (index, key) => (
        <li key={key}>{index}</li>
    );

    render() {
        return (
            <List itemsLength={1000} itemsRenderer={this.itemsRenderer}>
                {this.itemRenderer}
            </List>
        );
    }
}
```

Note that as `<List>` is a `PureComponent`, so it can keep itself from re-rendering. It's highly recommended to pass referenced methods for `children` and `itemsRenderer` (in this case instance methods), so that it can successfully shallow compare props.

## Why React Intersection List?

The approach to infinite scrolling was commonly done by devs implementing throttled `scroll` event callbacks. This keeps the main thread unnecessarily busy... No more! `IntersectionObservers`' invoke callbacks in a **low-priority and asynchronous** way by design.

> **Agent Smith:** Never send a human to do a machine's job.

The implementation follows these steps:

1. Add a sentinel close to the last item in the list
2. Update the list moving the internal cursor
3. Trigger a callback when the sentinel comes into view
4. Reposition the recycled sentinel at the end
5. Repeat (âˆž) ?

## Documentation

### Options

- **children**: `(index: number, key: number) => React.Element<*>`

- **itemsRenderer**: `(items: Array<React.Element<*>>, ref: Element) => React.Element<*>`

- **itemsLength**: `number` | default: `0` (number of items to render)

- **hasMore**: `bool` | default: `false` (if true forces the sentinel to observe)

- **threshold**: `string` | default: `100px` (specify using units _px_ or _%_ without negative values)

- **axis**: `'x' | 'y'` | Default: `y`

- **pageSize**: `number` | Default: `10`

- **initialIndex**: `number` | Default: `0`

- **onIntersection**: `(size: number, pageSize: number) => void` (invoked when the sentinel comes into view)
